## Welcome!

So, this is just an initial start. Nothing much here now. Will try to populate this page soon.  
Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to check my [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/abedkhooli).  
This page was inspired by [this post](https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/five-minutes-to-your-own-website-fd0b43cbd886) and this [getting started](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). If you are new to markdown, here's a [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 
More on [gitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).
This is [Prose](http://prose.io/) - content editor for GitHub.
